    <p> <h4 style="font-size: larger;"><i>Iam a person who is positive about every aspect of life.
         There are many thingsI like to do to see, and to experience. I like to read, I like to write 
         I like to think, I like to dream; I like to talk, I like to listen. I like to see the sunrise in the morning,
          I like to see the moonlight at night; I like to feel the music flowing on my face, 
          I like to smell the wind coming from the ocean.<br>
          I like to look at the clouds in the sky with a blank mind, 
          I like to do thought experiment when I cannot sleep in the middle of the night.
           I like flowers in spring, rain in summer, leaves in autumn, and snow in winter.
            I like to sleep early, I like to get up late; I like to be alone, I like to be surrounded by people.
             I like country,s peace, I like metropolis noise; I like delicious food and comfortable shoes;
              I like romantic movies. I like the land and the nature, I like people. And, I like to laugh.</i></h4></p>
